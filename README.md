# AtChemTools
This repository brings together several tools designed to be used alongside [AtChem2](https://github.com/AtChem/AtChem2) with two main aims: 
-	To assist in the running of models through automated scripts
-	To assist in the analysis of output from AtChem2 models

Note that these tools provide greater flexibility than the tools provided as part of the AtChem2 source code, but are not designed to be used ‘out-of-the-box’. AtChemTools currently exists as a collection of Python functions that can be imported into your own custom Python scripts.

AtChemTools is intended to act as a collaborative hub for all AtChem2 users to share their tools for use alongside AtChem2. If you are an AtChem2 user, you are encouraged to consider contributing to this repository by suggesting additions and modifications to the existing code. If you use AtChem2 and analyse your data in a programming language other than Python, then you should still feel welcome to contribute. Get in touch and we will discuss how best to adapt the repository layout to include your contributions.

## Directory Structure

-	`AtChemTools` contains the Python functions intended to be imported into user’s own Python scripts
-	‘Examples’ contains a series of Python scripts intended to demonstrate common use-cases for the functions defined in the `AtChemTools` directory. Note that these scripts will not work until AtChemTools has been properly added to your Python path (as described in the Installation section).
